    <p>
        My name is Vlad, I am 22 right now, and I am a programmer from Russia, Saratov. I am Java backend developer, but
        I have interests in other areas, for example in computer graphics, game development, functional programming.

        <br><br>

        In this blog, I want to save and share my notes, thoughts, articles about programming or something else. If
        someone will find them useful I will be really happy.

        <br><br>
