### Why another yet game engine?

I am a student of the Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technologies of Saratov State University. All of my course works and, thus, bachelor's degree work were about computer graphics and about OpenGL in particular. I needed to write some demo application to investigate OpenGL features and then show them. At the beginning it was just a window that could display the OpenGL context. But it slowly gained new features such as user control and scripting. This application was pretty close to the name "game engine". I was really excited that only one unskilled programmer can implement large and complex applcation such as a game engine.

Thus, I'm just inspired to write another yet game engine. It's name "Doodle Game Engine". Why "Doodle"? I don't know. May be because I'm really bad C++ programmer (yes, it will be coded on this language). I hope it will be a killer of all modern game engines.
